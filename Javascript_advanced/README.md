Variable scope, closure
JavaScript is a very function-oriented language. It gives us a lot of freedom. A function can be created at any moment, passed as an argument to another function, and then called from a totally different place of code later.

We already know that a function can access variables outside of it (“outer” variables).

But what happens if outer variables change since a function is created? Will the function get newer values or the old ones?

And what if a function is passed along as an argument and called from another place of code, will it get access to outer variables at the new place?

Let’s expand our knowledge to understand these scenarios and more complex ones.
